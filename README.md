===Induction heater design files===

WARNING: THIS DESIGN IS UNTESTED. ADDITIONALLY, IF YOU ATTEMPT TO BUILD ONE
OF THESE WITHOUT FULLY UNDERSTANDING WHAT YOU'RE DOING, YOU WILL PROBABLY DIE.
DON'T SAY I DIDN'T WARN YOU!

Now that that's out of the way: this repository contains the design files for
an induction heater meant to heat metals to forging or melting temperature.

Rough specs:

- 3.5kW design power (just right for a standard 230V circuit in the Netherlands)
- Water-cooled work coil so we can heat fairly conductive metal like aluminium
- Main power stage uses salvaged parts from an induction cooktop.
- Microcontroller-based control system

It's still a work in progress, contact the primary suspect (Roy Smeding;
roy.smeding@gmail.com) for more information.
